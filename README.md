### Introductions;


  Hey, I'm **David/Geandert**, and I'm currently studying Games Development in University.
  I like to work on projects in my spare time, and have a passion for learning ways in which computing is applied to many different industries. 
 
  I'm a fan of all of the _nerd stuff_ and enjoy Gaming...hence the interest in Games Dev,
  and I plan on making games in different genres, and researching how to do so in a way which innovates and captures the attention of my audience.

### About Me; 


  As stated, I'm a Student Games Developer, and although my abilities aren't quite professional level yet - I have a working understanding of C++, C#, HTML, CSS and Python
  and I'm always looking to take on new projects relating to Games, Software which will benefit wider communities and even smaller-scale projects such as Mods within games. 

  Personally however, I'm into Gaming, Anime and the like, and I do enjoy discussing and taking inspiration from these forms of media in order to make my own projects incredibly
  innovative, creative and aesthetically pleasing! I am always looking to collaborate, so give me a comment here or drop me a message on Twitter! (Linked Above)
