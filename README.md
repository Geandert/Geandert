### Introductions;


  Hey, I'm **David/Geandert**, and I'm currently studying Games Development in University.
  I like to work on projects in my spare time, and have a passion for learning ways in which computing is applied to many different industries. 
 
  I'm a fan of all of the _nerd stuff_ and enjoy Gaming...hence the interest in Games Dev,
  and I plan on making games in different genres, and researching how to do so in a way which innovates and captures the attention of my audience.

### About Me; 


  As stated, I'm a Student Games Developer, and although my abilities aren't quite professional level yet - I have a working understanding of C++, C#, HTML, CSS and Python
  and I'm always looking to take on new projects relating to Games, Software which will benefit wider communities and even smaller-scale projects such as Mods within games. 

  Personally however, I'm into Gaming, Anime and the like, and I do enjoy discussing and taking inspiration from these forms of media in order to make my own projects incredibly
  innovative, creative and aesthetically pleasing! I am always looking to collaborate, so give me a comment here or drop me a message on Twitter! (Linked Above)

 ### What I believe in;
 
  I'm a firm believer in Open Source Software, and the benefit it can bring for both transparency, support, and the economy.
  
  I also believe in the Right to Repair movement, and I will _always_ actively and morally support it. There is absolutely no benefit to brushing Right to Repair aside,
  and I would urge those who are reading this and asking to themselves _"what is Right to Repair?"_ to research members of the community such as Louis Rossmann, and Repair.Eu. 
  
  This affects **everyone** no matter how technologically savvy you are. If you own a laptop, desktop, washing machine, mobile phone, tablet, Television - you are involved and     you should get involved!
