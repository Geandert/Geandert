  - I'm open to do projects of any kind! I'm currently studying C++ and soon to study C#, but I have a _working_ knowledge in Python, and a passion to learn!
    I usually have a preference for projects that have a clear end-goal, and help within the wider community, or unique projects, but I also collaborate to have fun! 


You can find me on many forms of social media, ranging from Discord, Twitter and Steam, ranging from more obscure platforms such as Amino. 

Come say Hey!
